# Escape Duty

Use escapism as an opportunity to reflect on your current situation.  See [this
blog
post](https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2016/06/18/gated-game-approach-to-a-better-life/).

The idea is that, if you visit a website on some list (e.g. Facebook), then this
extension will ask you:

* whether you're doing this for a specific purpose or for general entertainment
* if the first, then what that purpose is
* if the second, then what you think about your current situation (e.g. whether
  you're stuck on other things)

After that you can visit the website normally for some time period.  This prompt is not
meant to feel guilt-inducing: it should feel like a good opportunity to identify
ways that you feel stuck.
